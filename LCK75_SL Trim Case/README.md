#### Trim case .step files for the LCK75_SL.

An attempt at a top mountish case. The pictures of the completed keyboard with the 3D printed case trim are from these files.

- All holes are for M2 screws.
- The top pieces slide in between the keyplate and PCB. 
- The raised rear section to enclose the acrylic guard was designed to use 10mm M2 standoffs with a 3mm thick acrylic guard for a flush finish. In my pictures I used 0.08" (~2mm) thick acrylic.
- The bottom pieces attach to the bottom PCB and is joined to the top with screws around the permieter.
- Depending on the density, A 5mm thick foam with cutouts for the hotswap sockets can be used. 3mm thick foam without cutouts can be used.

#### Notes:
- Mounting tabs for the PCB are based on the unmodified PCB holes.
- Two addional tabs added under the ESC and rotary encoder for the modified keyswitch plate.
- Holes under the third row (middle) are too close to the keyswitch and depending on the style of screw used the screw head can block the keyswitch from being quickly hotswappable.
- There might be some issues with holes not lining up with the PCB as the switch plate and main PCB dimensions are not identical. Lining them up prior to creating the case pieces was done as best as I could.
